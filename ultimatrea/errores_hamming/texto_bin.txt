How do HDLC-frames work.
HDLC-frames can be trans
mitted over either. Asyn
chronous or synchronous 
communication links Sync
hronous framing. In sync
hronous frames data is N
RZI non-return-to-zero i
nverted encoded meaning 
that a 0-bit is sent as 
a change in the signal. 
Whereas 1-bit is transmi
tted as no change.In oth
er words every 0 relays 
to the receiving modem t
hat it must synchronize 
its clock. In this way. 
frames can be sent via a
 full-duplex or half-dup
lex link. Asynchronous f
raming. On .the other ha
nd- in asynchronous comm
unications 10111110 bit 
sequence with the least 
significant bit first. W
hen sending HDLC--frames
the frame check sequence
 of an HDLC-frame is eit
her a 16--bit CRC-CCITT 
or a 32-bit CRC-32 trans
mitted over Information 
Control or Address field
s CRC stands for cyclic-
.redundancy check. HDLC-
.frames provide the medi

s I-frames which transmi
t user data from the com
puter network layer and 
incorporate error contro
