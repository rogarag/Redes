How do HDLC-frames work.
HDLC-frames can be transmitted over either. 
Asynchronous or synchronous communication links
Synchronous framing. In synchronous frames data 
is NRZI non-return-to-zero inverted encoded 
meaning that a 0-bit is sent as a 
change in the signal. 
Whereas 1-bit is transmitted as no change. 
In other words every 0 relays to the receiving modem 
that it must synchronize its clock. In this way. 
frames can be sent via a full-duplex
 or half-duplex link. Asynchronous framing. On 
 .the other hand-
in asynchronous communications 10111110  
bit sequence with the least significant bit first.
When sending HDLC--frames
 the frame check sequence of an HDLC-frame is 
either a 16--bit CRC-CCITT or a 32-bit CRC-32
transmitted over Information Control or Address fields CRC 
stands for cyclic-.redundancy check. HDLC-.frames provide
the medium for
Information frames I-frames which transmit user data from the computer network 
layer and incorporate error control information with the data. 
I-frames also contain control fields used to define data functions.
Supervisory frames S-frames  which transmit error and flow control data 
whenever it becomes impossible to piggyback on transmitted data. For this reason 
 -S-frames do not contain information fields.-
Unnumbered frames U-frames which are for all other miscellaneous purposes
including link management. Some of these contain information fields and others do not.
